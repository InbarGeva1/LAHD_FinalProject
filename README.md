# Project Title: LAHD Affordable Housing Data Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict the allocation of third-party funds (LEVERAGE) in Los Angeles Affordable Housing Development (LAHD) projects. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to optimize the allocation of resources to ensure that investments are directed to the areas where they can have the greatest impact in addressing housing needs within the city.

## Objective

Our project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast the amount of third-party funding (LEVERAGE column) required for new affordable housing projects in Los Angeles. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we intend to assist LAHD in efficiently allocating resources and investments to maximize the impact on affordable housing development within the city.

## Dataset

We used the [HCIDLA Affordable Housing Projects List (2003 to Present)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/hcidla-affordable-housing-projects-list-2003-to-present) dataset as our main source of data. This dataset contains detailed information about affordable housing projects in Los Angeles, including project details, funding sources, development stages, housing types, and more.
